    Introduction: We've implemented exhaustive search for you below.

    You don't need to implement any extra code for this part.
'''

# Given an instance of the Graph class G, exhaustively search for a k-coloring
# Returns the coloring list if one exists, None otherwise.
def exhaustive_search_coloring(G, k=3):

    # Iterate through every possible coloring of nodes
    for coloring in product(range(0,k), repeat=G.N):
        G.colors = list(coloring)
        if G.is_graph_coloring_valid():
            return G.colors

    # If no valid coloring found, reset colors and return None
    G.reset_colors()
    return None


'''
    Part A: Implement two coloring via breadth-first search.

    Hint: You will need to adapt the given BFS pseudocode so that it works on all graphs,
    regardless of whether they are connected.

    When you're finished, check your work by running python3 -m ps5_color_tests 2.
'''

# Given an instance of the Graph class G and a subset of precolored nodes,
# Assigns precolored nodes to have color 2, and attempts to color the rest using colors 0 and 1.
# Precondition: Assumes that the precolored_nodes form an independent set.
# If successful, modifies G.colors and returns the coloring.
# If no coloring is possible, resets all of G's colors to None and returns None.
def bfs_2_coloring(G, precolored_nodes=None):
    # Assign every precolored node to have color 2
    # Initialize visited set to contain precolored nodes if they exist
    visited = set()
    G.reset_colors()
    preset_color = 2
    if precolored_nodes is not None:
        for node in precolored_nodes:
            G.colors[node] = preset_color
            visited.add(node)

        if len(precolored_nodes) == G.N:
            return G.colors
    
    # TODO: Complete this function by implementing two-coloring using the colors 0 and 1.
    # If there is no valid coloring, reset all the colors to None using G.reset_colors()
    
    G.reset_colors()
    return None

'''
    Part B: Implement is_independent_set.
'''

# Given an instance of the Graph class G and a subset of precolored nodes,
# Checks if subset is an independent set in G 
def is_independent_set(G, subset):
    # TODO: Complete this function

    return True

'''
    Part C: Implement the 3-coloring algorithm from the sender receiver exercise.
    
    Make sure to call the bfs_2_coloring and is_independent_set functions that you already implemented!

    Hint 1: You will want to use the Python `combinations` function from the itertools library
    to enumerate all possible independent sets. Remember that each element of combinations is a tuple,
    so you may need to convert it to a list.

    Hint 2: Python itertools functions compute their results lazily, which means that they only
    calculate each element as the program requests it. This saves time and space, since it
    doesn't need to store the entire list of combinations up front. You should NOT try to convert the result
    of the entire combinations call to a list, since that will force Python to precompute everything.
    Instead, you should iterate over them in a for loop, which will maintain the lazy behavior we want.
    See the call to "product" in exhaustive_search for an example.

    When you're finished, check your work by running python3 -m ps5_color_tests 3.
    Don't worry if some of your tests time out: that is expected.
